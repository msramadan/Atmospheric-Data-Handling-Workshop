# Atmospheric-Data-Handling-Workshop
Applied Data Handling Techniques for Air Pollution Modelling

In this workshop, we will do the following:
- Extracting MODIS MCD19A2CMG product data and storing it as dataset.
- Spatial resampling and data assimilation techniques for harmonizing multi-source datasets.
- A custom method I developed for estimating time series averages for small shapefiles situated between grid cells (tentatively titled: Edge-Weighted Averaging).
- Creating spatially and temporally lagged features for modeling.
